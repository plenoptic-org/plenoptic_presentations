#note: To take one particularly illustrative example: I'm sure many of you recognize this picture. It's an image of supermassive black hole M87, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration in April 2019

#note: this hit the headlines of every major news outlet, with the image eventually reaching more than 4.5 billion people around the world

the work that went into this was done with a variety of packages from the open-source python scientific ecosystem, such as numpy and matplotlib, which was credited by some of the scientists involved as making the work possible, preventing them from having to reinvent everything from scratch

#note: yet five days after this announcement, the US National Science Foundation denied a grant to support that ecosystem, saying the software didn't have "sufficient impact"
